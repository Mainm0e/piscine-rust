// Imagine you are designing a new video game and you have to create
// food that they players can take to gain strength there are two
// types of food for now fruits and meet: fruits increases the
// strengths by 1 unit and meat increases it by 3 unit.

// Define both structures fruits and meat
// Define the std::fmt::Display trait of the Player structure so using
// the template {} inside a println! macro will print in the first
// line the name of the player
// in the second line the strength, score and the money
// and in the third line the weapons
